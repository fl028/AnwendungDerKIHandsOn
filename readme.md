# Anwendungen der KÃ¼nstlichen Intelligenz
## Hands-on project DHBW CAS SoSe23

The project includes exemplary implementations of Deep Learning use cases from various textbooks. Keras and Tensorflow are mainly used.

Script 03: The prototype follows an exemplary implementation by the author Chollet. The task is to identify handwritten digits. The images are taken from the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) dataset and contains 10 000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
